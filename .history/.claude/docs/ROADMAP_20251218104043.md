# Roadmap

## V1: Core + Django (MVP)

- [ ] `litefs-py` core: settings, config generation, primary detection
- [ ] `litefs-django` adapter: settings reader, DB backend
- [ ] Static leader election (manual failover, 2-node minimum)
- [ ] Management commands (status, check)
- [ ] Unit tests with in-memory adapters
- [ ] Example Django app in `examples/django-app/`

## V2: Raft Leader Election

- [ ] `py-leader` package: Raft wrapper around PySyncObj (separate project)
- [ ] Integrate `py-leader` into `litefs-py` as optional dependency
- [ ] Automatic failover (3-node quorum)
- [ ] Health checks with leader status
- [ ] Integration tests with multi-node Docker Compose

## V3: FastAPI + Polish

- [ ] `litefs-fastapi` adapter: middleware, routes
- [ ] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Development mode (single-node, no replication)
- [ ] Documentation site (ReadTheDocs or similar)

## Open Questions

- [ ] Graceful handling of split-brain scenarios (Raft handles this, document edge cases)
